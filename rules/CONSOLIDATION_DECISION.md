# CONSOLIDATION DECISION

## Trigger
Creating something that might duplicate existing work.

## Decision Tree
```
Is there an older project doing similar things?
├─ NO → Continue
└─ YES → Does new fully replace old?
    ├─ NO → Keep both, document relationship
    └─ YES → Follow CONSOLIDATION_PROCESS rule
```

## Before Deciding
- Check GitHub for similar repos
- Check Memory MCP for related entities
- Ask Claude if uncertain
