# SELF-LEARNING ASSESSMENT

## Trigger
After completing any task.

## Decision Tree
```
Did this task involve:
├─ Fixing something that broke? → Follow DETECTION_RULE_TEMPLATE
├─ Doing something repetitive? → Follow SKILL_CREATION_TEMPLATE
├─ Finding something hard to find? → Follow INDEX_ENTRY_CREATION
└─ None of above → No action needed
```

## Questions to Ask
1. What broke or was missing?
2. Could a rule have prevented this?
3. Could a skill automate this next time?

If YES to 2 or 3 → create it NOW.
