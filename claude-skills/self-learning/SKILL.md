# Self-Learning Assessment

## Trigger
After completing any task.

## Decision Tree
Did this task involve:
- Fixing something that broke? → Create detection rule
- Doing something repetitive? → Create skill
- Finding something hard to find? → Create index entry
- None of above → No action needed

## Questions to Ask
1. What broke or was missing?
2. Could a rule have prevented this?
3. Could a skill automate this next time?

If YES to 2 or 3 → create it NOW.
