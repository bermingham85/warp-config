# Error Handling Process

## Trigger
A command fails or error occurs.

## Steps
1. **STOP** - Don't compound the problem
2. **ASSESS** - What exactly failed? Read error message.
3. **LOG** - Record error in Memory MCP if significant
4. **ROUTE** - Can I fix this? Or need user input?
5. **FIX or ESCALATE** - Apply fix, or ask user

## Don't Do
- Ignore errors and continue
- Retry same thing without understanding why it failed
- Hide failures from user
