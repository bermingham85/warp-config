# MCP Tools First

## MANDATORY BEHAVIOR
Before searching the web or researching documentation:

1. **CHECK YOUR TOOLS FIRST** - You have MCP tools available. Check what tools you have before assuming you need to search.

2. **Tools Location**: MCP tools in config.json

3. **Available Servers**:
   - memory - persistent memory across sessions
   - github - GitHub operations
   - filesystem - file operations
   - sequential-thinking - step-by-step reasoning
   - postgres - database queries
   - notion - Notion pages/databases
   - n8n - workflow automation
   - playwright - browser automation
   - perplexity - web search

4. **DO NOT** waste tokens:
   - Searching for how to do something you have a tool for
   - Researching APIs when you have an MCP for that service

## Priority Order
1. Check existing MCP tools
2. Use MCP tools if available
3. Only search/research if no MCP tool exists
